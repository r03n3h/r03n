Born in Amsterdam in 1978, raised in Amstelveen. Started after primary school at the VWO, continued on the HAVO and finally proud owner of a MAVO diploma. Started again with HAVO but dropped out of school, left home and started working at the age of 17. After having lived in all Amsterdam city districts, I now live in Amsterdam West with my girlfriend and 3 children (daughter of 16, son of 12 and another daughter of 3 years). Now, after many wanderings, evening courses, day courses and self-study, I have made the desiccion to et back to Cyberspace :).<b>

<h2>Let's take a look at that history</h2>
<h4>1986</h4> When I was 8 years old (1986) I was already working with computers. Before I was 10 I was already writing small commands/code in Basic on my Commendore C64 with the bizarre 64kb of memory!
<h4>1990</h4> When I was 11 or 12 I got the old server from my father's company, an Olivetti CP 486. I can't remember how much memory was in it, but the max was 64MB. There were 2 hard disks of 16MB each (weighing 10KG each), so the memory may have been less. On this computer was MS-DOS and on it I learned to write in QBASIC, but I also came into contact with BBS (Bulletin board system). A kind of teletext. <!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdr4zeE3JU -->
<h4>1995</h4> In 1995 I took the first steps in HTML. Together with an external company I built a website with a CMS system, this CMS system ran on MS Access (the changes that were made in the MS Access database were read into the website by means of text files.
<h4>1998</h4> In 1998 I trained as a job specialist. Baan was a Dutch ERP system developed by the Baan brothers and was/is used by Boeing, among others. In 1999 I took care of the implementation of Baan IV within my father's company.
<h4>2001</h4> In 2001 I completed a shortened training course to become a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer via a boot camp and in 2002 I successfully completed the evening course General Entrepreneurial Skills (middle class diploma).
<h4>2005</h4> With this I was ready to become an independent entrepreneur and in 2005 I continued as a self-employed person. Together with a partner, I started maintaining small-scale networks in the region and building web applications. In 2006 I followed various training courses to specialize myself. i.a. Dreamweaver, Joomla CRM and HTML & CSS followed.
<h4>2007</h4> Besides my love for computers I also have a love for food and drink, cooking with wine :). In 2007 I got the opportunity to take over my favorite restaurant and I started this adventure with my then girlfriend. This meant after 1 year that I had to make a choice with my partner of the IT company and we then split up and I only started to focus on Horeca and Hosting.
<h4>2016</h4> The restaurant was closed in 2016 and I still held a number of positions within the Amsterdam hospitality industry. In 2018 I returned to my father's company to replace the Commercial Director. There I also came into contact with the ERP system that I had implemented 20 years earlier. Now time for something new!
<h4>2021</h4> With the help of a friend I ended up at Pathways, I first did a part of the TekkieWorden trail. My IT path has become somewhat clearer, but a choice has not yet been made. The love for it is back and I'm sure I want to continue in it. During the 4 weeks of PathWays I started with #100DaysOfCode, already completed the Responsive Webdesign Certification from freeCodeCamp, enrolled in Web Development 2.0 at WINC and Junior Data Engineer at BitAcademy. 
<h4>2022</h4> I hope to start the Ethical Hacker bootcamp at NOVI in February 2022 or the Cyber Security specialist at HVA.

More of a Pi-shape profile than a T-shape profile. Ultimately the solution will be that I gain enough knowledge, can build an app that can make the choice for me what I will do in 2 years :)
